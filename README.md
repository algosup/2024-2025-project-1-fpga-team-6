# ‚ú® Frogger FPGA Team 6 ‚ú®

## What is the purpose of this project? üìö

This project aims to create a Frogger game using the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology. We handle input, output, screen display and even memory management using Verilog.

## What is Frogger? üê∏

- The goal of the game is to move a frog from the bottom of the screen to the top. There‚Äôs only one problem: The frog is trying to cross a busy highway filled with cars! You must carefully control the frog to cross the road without getting hit by a car.

Our Frogger game will contain colorful sprites, though no sounds can be handled as the only way we can display the game on a monitor is with a VGA port.

## How can we play the game? üïπÔ∏è

To play the game, you'll need to have some <u>required elements</u>:

- A [Go-Board](https://nandland.com/cart/)
- A [VGA compatible monitor](https://www.amazon.com./s?k=vga+monitor&crid=1SGS6CI178TBH&sprefix=vga+mo%2Caps%2C207&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_6)
- A [VGA cable](https://www.amazon.com./s?k=vga+cable&crid=1N29E5VSJS1W4&sprefix=vga%2Caps%2C199&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_3)
- A [micro-USB cable](https://www.amazon.com./s?k=micro-usb+cable&crid=L7H96RRAM5DF&sprefix=micro-us%2Caps%2C158&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_8)

### macOS Setup

Then, you'll need to setup apio on your machine. 
To do this, follow the steps on this [link](https://nandland.com/set-up-apio-fpga-build-and-program/).

Once you've setup the software, all you need is 
- [download our latest release](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-1-fpga-team-6/releases)
- connect the board to your computer with the micro-USB cable
- upload it into the board using the `apio upload` command on your terminal (make sure you're in the Frogger folder!)

Then, if the board is correctly plugged and connected to a VGA monitor, the game will launch!

## LilyPad ü™∑

LilyPad is a console we've made beside the Frogger game. The Go-Board contains the game you want to play, you put it correctly inside the console, and it's plug & play!

The console has been constructed to contain the Go-Board, letting the 7-Segment displays visible.
Also, the Pmods have been placed specifically to create controller plugs.

As we created a console, we needed to create controllers as well, and we did.

Note: The game is totally playable with only a Go-Board, but the console and controllers will allow a huge experience!

## Can we buy/recreate the console? üéÆüïπÔ∏èüëæ

Yes, you could be able to create your own LilyPad!
You can even order one to our team.

To know everything about the cost of a LilyPad, you can check this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F-HxhJdpekoRyOHcomrwG5_U2OMouyGQa8QbSrjasqM/edit?usp=sharing).

Also, you can check the [LilyPad Documentation](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-1-fpga-team-6/releases) to dive deeper into the subject!

## "FPGA"? How does this work? üíæ

The FPGA is a type of configurable integrated circuit that can be repeatedly programmed after manufacturing.
We actually used the Go-Board provided by Russell Merrick, who taught us how to deal with this technology at [ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com/en.html).

To be able to upload some code in this hardware, we used Verilog as a programming language.
