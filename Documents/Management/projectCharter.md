## Project Overview

This project aims to create a Froggy game using the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology. With the GO-BOARD provided by Russell MERRICK and ALGOSUP, we'll handle input, output, screen display and even memory management.

## Project Goals

We are wanting to perform few goals with this project:

- Recreate the original game with its features (20x15 grid, a controlable frog, harmful cars with random sizes and speed, collisions...)
- Add colors and animations to the game when we display it.
- Create a controller to enhance the user experience.

## Overall plan

To ensure the success of the project, the team will follow the following plan:

1. The team will start by understanding the client's needs and the current state of the project.
2. The team will define the most important features to develop and will write the functional and technical specifications.
3. The team will develop the software, write the test plan and the user manual.
4. Each time some code is written, the team will write unit tests and will add the bugs to the project's issues.
5. The team will write weekly reports and management planning to keep the client informed of the project's progress throughout the provided project time.
