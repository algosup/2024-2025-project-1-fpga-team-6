# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

The first week of the project has been dedicated to start the project, including the Verilog courses and the specifications.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project started well**
   - The project just started, and all the requirements have been given by the stakeholders performing us to understand them deeply.
2. **Functional specifications are well advanced**
    - The team has been working well on the specifications and the sprites.
3. **The development started**
    - The software engineer started to code for the project. That will have a huge impact as it allow us to be a bit advanced.

## Challenges

1. **Understanding the technology**
   - Understanding how FPGAs work and how to develop in Verilog has been quite tough, as it is low-level programming.
2. **Analyzing the original Frogger game**
    - Analyzing how Frogger has been made back to the 80s has been time-consuming.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish the functional specifications**
2. **Have a correct advance in the technical specifications creation**
3. **Fix the display issues with transparent color**

## Conclusion

The first week of the project has been dedicated to start the project. We've started to create the functional specifications, the sprites of the game and the code with unexpected progress.

# Weekly Report - Week 2

## Overview

This second week has been dedicated to finish the functional specifications and improve our code base.

## Accomplishments

1. **Functional specifications has been finished**
    - The remaining sprites have been made by the team, allowing us to be more precise in the specifications.
2. **Development advanced well**
    - The team made improvements on the code, such as the level score displayed on the 7-segment, detection collisions and sprite integrations.
3. **3D prints have been useful**
    - To accomplish all the aspects of the project we've set, we've needed to use 3D printing.

## Challenges

1. **Sprite redesign**
    - The sprite redesign have been quite tough, as we're trying to be as close to the original game as possible, though we also want to be imaginative.
2. **LUTs use**
    - As we did not use any block RAM, only LUTs, we ran out of LUTs (we're about +900 right now). The limit of LUTs is 1000.
3. **Purchases**
    - Some purchases have been made regarding the project, allowing us to go further in the project.

| Item                                   | Quantity | Unit Price TTC (€) | Total TTC (€) |
|----------------------------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Cosses Nues (Bare Terminals)           | 10       | 3.80           | 3.80      |
| Coffret Pinces à Cosses (Crimping Tool Kit) | 1       | 9.90           | 9.90      |
| **Total**                              |          |                | 13.70     |

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Advance on the technical specifications**
    - Move forward on the technical specifications to nearly finish it.
2. **Use blocks RAM**
    - The use of blocks RAM becomes important as we're reaching the limit of LUTs.

## Conclusion

The specifications are quite on their schedule, and we've made huge improvements on the code. Though the use of blocks RAM will be needed.

# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview

This third week was devoted to improving the technical specifications and optimizing the code base by using RAM blocks.

## Accomplishments

1. **Technical specifications are well advanced**
    - The team has been working well on the specifications and how we're gonna build the software.
2. **The code is optimized**
    - The code base has been reworked to use RAM blocks, allowing us to store sprites easily and implement more features onto the game.

## Challenges

1. **The difficult use of logic cells**
    - It began to be difficult to optimize the use of Logic Cells. (Limit: 1280)
2. **Purchases**
    - Some purchases have been made regarding the project, allowing us to go further in the project.

| Item | Quantity | Unit Price HT (€) | **Total HT (€)** | TVA rates | TVA (€) | Unit Price TTC (€) | **Total TTC (€)** |
|--------|----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CHUAZIZ 6 Sets Waterproof Connector Kit, 6-Pin DT Connectors, Automotive Electrical Wire Connector, Waterproof 6-Pin Male and Female Plugs | 4 | 13.32 | 53.28 | 20% | 10.68 | 15.99 | 63.96 |

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish the technical specifications**
2. **Advance on the other documents**
    - Move forward on the test plan, user manual and management documents.
3. **Improve the code base**
    - The code base needs a little bit of improvements to reach the MVP.

## Conclusion

This week saw solid progress in refining the technical specifications and optimizing the code by integrating RAM blocks. While logic cell optimization remains a challenge, we've made key hardware purchases to support further development.

# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

This fourth week was dedicated to finish the other documentations and the code base, as well as the side productions.

## Accomplishments

1. **Code base approximately finished**
    - The code base has been quite finished, a few improvements can be done, though the initial product has been done within the deadline.
2. **Documents finished**
    - The other documents, such as the test plan and the user manual have been finished within the deadline.

## Challenges

1. **Trade-off decisions**
    - The technology limitations have caused the team to make trade-offs. The river mechanics in the second half of the screen have therefore been replaced by another road. Also, only a few cars will be displayed at any one time, reducing consumption and enhancing playability.
2. **Side productions overwhelming**
    - The side productions have been quite overwhelming. All the team members did not focus on the same tasks at the same time, leading the team members to work harder.
3. **Purchases**
    - Some purchases have been made regarding the project, allowing us to go further in the project.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish the code base**
2. **Merge in the main branch**
3. **Prepare the presentation**

## Conclusion

The week has been quite productive, allowing us to approximately finish all the tasks we had to do, even if the FPGA's limitations have been quite tough to deal with.
The last task to perform will be the final presentation on the Friday 25th.

# Weekly Report - Week 5

## Overview

This week was dedicated to prepare the final presentation, as well as finish ohter productions.

## Accomplishments

1. **Presentation preparation**
    - All team members managed to prepare the presentation effectively.
2. **Productions finished**
    - All other productions have been successfully finished.

## Challenges

1. **Presentation deadlines**
    - The final presentation is done on the Friday. We had a small week to prepare it.
2. **Other productions**
    - The fact that we had to finish completely the other productions could be messy with the presentation.

## What's Next

1. **Post-mortem**
    - Performing a post-mortem of a pr0ject will be useful to know what we could have done better and improve ourselves.

## Conclusion

Performing a final presentation of a project can be stressful, so we did prepare it effectively. We'll need to do a post-mortem after the presentation.
