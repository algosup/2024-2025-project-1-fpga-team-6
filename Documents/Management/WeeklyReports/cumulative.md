# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

The first week of the project has been dedicated to start the project, including the Verilog courses and the specifications.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project started well**
   - The project just started, and all the requirements have been given by the stakeholders performing us to understand them deeply.
2. **Functional specifications are well advanced**
    - The team has been working well on the specifications and the sprites.
3. **The development started**
    - The software engineer started to code for the project. That will have a huge impact as it allow us to be a bit advanced.

## Challenges

1. **Understanding the technology**
   - Understanding how FPGAs work and how to develop in Verilog has been quite tough, as it is low-level programming.
2. **Analyzing the original Frogger game**
    - Analyzing how Frogger has been made back to the 80s has been time-consuming.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish the functional specifications**
2. **Have a correct advance in the technical specifications creation**
3. **Fix the display issues with transparent color**

## Conclusion

The first week of the project has been dedicated to start the project. We've started to create the functional specifications, the sprites of the game and the code with unexpected progress.

# Weekly Report - Week 2

## Overview

This second week has been dedicated to finish the functional specifications and improve our code base.

## Accomplishments

1. **Functional specifications has been finished**
    - THe remaining sprites have been made by the team, allowing us to be more precise in the specifications.
2. **Development advanced well**
    - The team made improvements on the code, such as the level score displayed on the 7-segment, detection collisions and sprite integrations.
3. **3D prints have been useful**
    - To accomplish all the aspects of the project we've set, we've needed to use 3D printing.

## Challenges

1. **Sprite redesign**
    - The sprite redesign have been quite tough, as we're trying to be as close to the original game as possible, though we also want to be imaginative.
2. **LUTs use**
    - As we did not use any block RAM, only LUTs, we ran out of LUTs (we're about +900 right now). The limit of LUTs is 1000.
3. **Purchases**
    - Some purchases have been made regarding the project, allowing us to go further in the project.

| Item                                   | Quantity | Unit Price TTC (€) | Total TTC (€) |
|----------------------------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Cosses Nues (Bare Terminals)           | 10       | 3.80           | 3.80      |
| Coffret Pinces à Cosses (Crimping Tool Kit) | 1       | 9.90           | 9.90      |
| **Total**                              |          |                | 13.70     |

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Advance on the technical specifications**
    - Move forward on the technical specifications to nearly finish it.
2. **Use blocks RAM**
    - The use of blocks RAM becomes important as we're reaching the limit of LUTs.

## Conclusion

The specifications are quite on their schedule, and we're made huge improvements on the code. Though the use of blocks RAM will be needed.
