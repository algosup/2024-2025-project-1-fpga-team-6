# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

The first week of the project has been dedicated to start the project, including the Verilog courses and the specifications.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project started well**
   - The project just started, and all the requirements have been given by the stakeholders performing us to understand them deeply.
2. **Functional specifications are well advanced**
    - The team has been working well on the specifications and the sprites.
3. **The development started**
    - The software engineer started to code for the project. That will have a huge impact as it allow us to be a bit advanced.

## Challenges

1. **Understanding the technology**
   - Understanding how FPGAs work and how to develop in Verilog has been quite tough, as it is low-level programming.
2. **Analyzing the original Frogger game**
    - Analyzing how Frogger has been made back to the 80s has been time-consuming.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish the functional specifications**
2. **Have a correct advance in the technical specifications creation**
3. **Fix the display issues with transparent color**

## Conclusion

The first week of the project has been dedicated to start the project. We've started to create the functional specifications, the sprites of the game and the code with unexpected progress.
