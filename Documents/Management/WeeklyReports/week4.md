# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

This fourth week was dedicated to finish the other documentations and the code base, as well as the side productions.

## Accomplishments

1. **Code base approximately finished**
    - The code base has been quite finished, a few improvements can be done, though the initial product has been done within the deadline.
2. **Documents finished**
    - The other documents, such as the test plan and the user manual have been finished within the deadline.

## Challenges

1. **Trade-off decisions**
    - The technology limitations have caused the team to make trade-offs. The river mechanics in the second half of the screen have therefore been replaced by another road.
2. **Side productions overwhelming**
    - The side productions have been quite overwhelming. All the team members did not focus on the same tasks at the same time, leading the team members to work harder.
3. **Purchases**
    - Some purchases have been made regarding the project, allowing us to go further in the project.
