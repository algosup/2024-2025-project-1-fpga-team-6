# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

This fourth week was dedicated to finish the other documentations and the code base, as well as the side productions.

## Accomplishments

1. **Code base approximately finished**
    - The code base has been quite finished, a few improvements can be done, though the initial product has been done within the deadline.
2. **Documents finished**
    - The other documents, such as the test plan and the user manual have been finished within the deadline.

## Challenges

1. **Trade-off decisions**
    - The technology limitations have caused the team to make trade-offs. The river mechanics in the second half of the screen have therefore been replaced by another road.
2. **Side productions overwhelming**
    - The side productions have been quite overwhelming. All the team members did not focus on the same tasks at the same time, leading the team members to work harder.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish the code base**
2. **Merge in the main branch**
3. **Prepare the presentation**

## Conclusion

The week has been quite productive, allowing us to approximately finish all the tasks we had to do. The last task to perform will be the final presentation on the Friday 25th.
