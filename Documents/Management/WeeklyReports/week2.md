# Weekly Report - Week 2

## Overview

This second week has been dedicated to finish the functional specifications and improve our code base.

## Accomplishments

1. **Functional specifications has been finished**
    - The remaining sprites have been made by the team, allowing us to be more precise in the specifications.
2. **Development advanced well**
    - The team made improvements on the code, such as the level score displayed on the 7-segment, detection collisions and sprite integrations.
3. **3D prints have been useful**
    - To accomplish all the aspects of the project we've set, we've needed to use 3D printing.

## Challenges

1. **Sprite redesign**
    - The sprite redesign have been quite tough, as we're trying to be as close to the original game as possible, though we also want to be imaginative.
2. **LUTs use**
    - As we did not use any block RAM, only LUTs, we ran out of LUTs (we're about +900 right now). The limit of LUTs is 1000.
3. **Purchases**
    - Some purchases have been made regarding the project, allowing us to go further in the project.

| Item                                   | Quantity | Unit Price TTC (€) | Total TTC (€) |
|----------------------------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Cosses Nues (Bare Terminals)           | 10       | 3.80           | 3.80      |
| Coffret Pinces à Cosses (Crimping Tool Kit) | 1       | 9.90           | 9.90      |
| **Total**                              |          |                | 13.70     |

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Advance on the technical specifications**
    - Move forward on the technical specifications to nearly finish it.
2. **Use blocks RAM**
    - The use of blocks RAM becomes important as we're reaching the limit of LUTs.

## Conclusion

The specifications are quite on their schedule, and we've made huge improvements on the code. Though the use of blocks RAM will be needed.
