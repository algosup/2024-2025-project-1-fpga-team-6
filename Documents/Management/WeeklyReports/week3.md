# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview

This third week was devoted to improving the technical specifications and optimizing the code base by using RAM blocks.

## Accomplishments

1. **Technical specifications are well advanced**
    - The team has been working well on the specifications and how we're gonna build the software.
2. **The code is optimized**
    - The code base has been reworked to use RAM blocks, allowing us to store sprites easily and implement more features onto the game.

## Challenges

1. **The difficult use of logic cells**
    - It began to be difficult to optimize the use of Logic Cells. (Limit: 1280)
2. **Purchases**
    - Some purchases have been made regarding the project, allowing us to go further in the project.

| Item | Quantity | Unit Price HT (€) | **Total HT (€)** | TVA rates | TVA (€) | Unit Price TTC (€) | **Total TTC (€)** |
|--------|----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CHUAZIZ 6 Sets Waterproof Connector Kit, 6-Pin DT Connectors, Automotive Electrical Wire Connector, Waterproof 6-Pin Male and Female Plugs | 4 | 13.32 | 53.28 | 20% | 10.68 | 15.99 | 63.96 |

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish the technical specifications**
2. **Advance on the other documents**
    - Move forward on the test plan, user manual and management documents.
3. **Improve the code base**
    - The code base needs a little bit of improvements to reach the MVP.

## Conclusion

This week saw solid progress in refining the technical specifications and optimizing the code by integrating RAM blocks. While logic cell optimization remains a challenge, we've made key hardware purchases to support further development.
