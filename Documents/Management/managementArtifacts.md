| 1   | FPGA is a technology to which we are not yet used to.                           | Development flow might be impacted.                                | High     | Medium     | Ask for help to the other team members.                                              |
| 2   | The VGA connection is quite old and not used anymore in recent monitors.                             | We might encounter some issues with the monitors.             | Medium   | Low        | Stick to a single monitor. |
| 3   | The sprite/color implementation could be quite hard to perform. | We might focus on the sprites integration rather than the main features. | High     | Low        | Focus on the main features.                        |
