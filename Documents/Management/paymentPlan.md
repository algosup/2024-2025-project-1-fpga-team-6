# Employee Payment Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the payment structure, frequency, and other financial details for team members.
All salaries used in this document are net.

## Payment Structure

The salary of all the employees will be set at an annual base of $73,000.

To calculate the hourly wage from an annual salary of $73,000, we're going to use the following formula:

1. Calculate the total number of work hours in a year:
   - Standard workweek: 35 hours
   - Weeks in a year: 52

   Total work hours = \(35 \text{ hours/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 1,820 \text{ hours/year}\)

2. Now, divide the annual salary by the total work hours:

  \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{73,000}{1,820} \approx 40.11
   \]

So, each employee would earn approximately **$40.11 per hour** as a **salary base**.

The work hours will be the scheduled project hours.

---

Overtime pay will be calculated at 120% the hourly wage for hours worked beyond the standard hours scheduled per week.
For instance:

   \[
    \text{Overtime Hourly rate} = {40.11}\times\frac{120}{100} = 40.11 \times 1.2 \approx 48.13
    \]

**Overtime** will be paid approximately **$48.13 per hour**.
