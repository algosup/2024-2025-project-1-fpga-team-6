# Employee Payment Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the payment structure, frequency, and other financial details for team members.  
All salaries specified in this document are **net** salaries.

## Payment Structure

The salary of all employees is set at an annual base of **$73,000**.

To calculate the hourly wage from an annual salary of $73,000, the following formula is used:

1. **Total annual work hours**:
   - Standard workweek: 35 hours
   - Weeks per year: 52

   \[
   \text{Total work hours} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 1,820 \text{ hours/year}
   \]

2. **Hourly rate calculation**:

   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{73,000}{1,820} \approx 40.11
   \]

Each employee will earn approximately **$40.11 per hour** as a base salary. The scheduled work hours are defined by the specific project hours.

## Payment Frequency

Employees will be paid on a **monthly** basis. Monthly payment is calculated by dividing the annual salary into 12 equal installments:

   \[
   \text{Monthly salary} = \frac{73,000}{12} \approx 6,083.33
   \]

Each employee will earn approximately **$40.11 per month** as a base salary.

## Overtime Payment

Overtime will be compensated at **120%** of the hourly wage for any hours worked beyond the standard 35 hours per week. The overtime rate is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Overtime hourly rate} = 40.11 \times 1.2 \approx 48.13
\]

Thus, overtime work will be paid at approximately **$48.13 per hour**.

## Additional Considerations

1. **Rounding**: All hourly rates and salary figures are rounded to the nearest two decimal places for simplicity in calculation.
2. **Sick Leave**: Employees are entitled to **5 paid sick days** per year.
3. **Payroll Deductions**: No deductions (such as taxes, benefits, etc.) are taken in charge, as this document considers net salaries only.
