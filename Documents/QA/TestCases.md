## This is the template of how the test cases will be documented for this project.


| ID | Date  | Priority | Test case Scenario                                  | Test case Description     | Pre-conditions    | Test Steps                   | Expected Results                                                |
| -- | --- | -------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01/001 | 01/01/1970 | HIGH | run the program, and see what's displayed | make sure the frog is diplayed correctly | have the most up-dated version of the product | 1. run the program 2. see the result | the frog is displayed |

**Priority**<br>
The priority level of the test case (High, Medium, Low).
- High: A major feature needs to be tested as soon as possible.
- Medium: A feature that could be important needs to be tested.
- Low: A non-required feature needs to be tested.

**Test case Scenario**<br>

**Test case Description** <br>
A clear and concise description of what the purpose of the test case is. The tester will need to precise if he proced a unit test.
